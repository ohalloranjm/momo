## Slash Commands

### Create & Manage Player Characters

Each Discord account may have up to five player characters (PCs).

* ``/newpc``: Create a new player character and set it to active.
* ``/pclist``: List all of your created PCs.
* ``/switchpc``: Change your active PC to a different PC youâ€™ve already created.
* ``/pcinfo``: Display all information about your active PC.
* ``/delete-pc``: Delete a player character from your account.

### Rolling Moves

These commands work best after you create a character: they will automatically pull any relevant stats from your active PC. They still work if you have no PCs; you just need to manually set your modifiers.

* ``/assess``: Assess a Situation
* ``/guide``: Guide and Comfort Someone
* ``/intimidate``: Intimidate an NPC
* ``/plead``: Plead with an NPC
* ``/push``: Push Your Luck
* ``/rely``: Rely on Your Skills & Training
* ``/trick``: Trick an NPC
---
* ``/callout``: Call Someone Out
* ``/deny``: Deny a Callout
* ``/resist``: Resist Shifting Your Balance
---
* ``/stance``: stance move
* ``/training``: training move

### Marking Fatigue and Conditions

* ``/c`` or ``/condition``: Mark one or more conditions.
* ``/f`` or ``/fatigue``: Mark one or more fatigue.
