# Slash Commands

Momo takes the following slash commands.

## Creating & Managing Player Characters

Each Discord account may have up to five player characters. Only one of your PCs is [active PC](./active-pc.md) at any given time.

- [`/newpc`](newpc.md): Create a new player character.
- [`/pclist`](pclist.md): List all of your created PCs.
- [`/switchpc`](switchpc.md): Change your active PC to a different PC you’ve already created.
- [`/pcinfo`](pcinfo.md): Display all information about your active PC.
- [`/delete-pc`](delete-pc.md): Delete a player character from your account.
- [`/changestat`](changestat.md): Change your active PC’s Creativity, Harmony, Focus, or Passion.
- [`/changename`](changename.md): Change your active PC’s name.
- [`/newtraining`](newtraining.md): Add a new training to your active PC, or replace their existing training(s).

## Rolling Moves

The [move-rolling commands](_move-rolling-commands.md) work best after you create a character: they will automatically pull any relevant stats and conditions from your active PC. They still work if you have no PCs; you’ll just need to manually set your modifiers using the `extra-modifier` or `override-modifier` option.
