# Momo User Guide

Follow the [installation guide](installation-guide.md) (forthcoming) to add Momo to your Discord server.

See the [slash commands directory](commands) for details on Momo’s functionality.

## Notes

This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the rules of [_Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game_](https://magpiegames.com/pages/avatarrpg).

Some bot responses are labeled as "ephemeral". An [ephemeral](<(https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000580222-Ephemeral-Messages-FAQ)>) reply is one that only the iniatiating user (usually, the person the who typed the slash command) can see.
