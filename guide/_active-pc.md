# Active Player Character

Many of Momo’s slash commands only interact with your “active” player character (PC). For example, when you [roll a basic move](_move-rolling-commands.md), Momo will apply modifiers based on your active character’s stats and conditions, ignoring any other characters associated with your account.

If you have created any PCs (and not deleted all of them), then one and only one of them is always active. You can [change your active PC](switchpc.md) at any time, choosing from any of the other PCs in your roster. Your active character is also changed automatically whenever you [create a PC](newpc.md) or [delete your active PC](delete-pc.md).
